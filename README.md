# NaijaMart App - Full Stack MERN Application

This is a **Movie Review App** I built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app will allow users to browse and rate movies, and provides an **admin panel** for managing movies, actors, and reviews. This project demonstrates my skills in Full Stack development and includes both the **frontend** and **backend** components integrated into a single application.

## Project Status

This project is a **work in progress**. While the core functionality has been implemented, several advanced features are still under development. Hereâ€™s an overview of the current status:

- **Movie Rating**: The feature allowing users to rate movies on a scale from 1 to 10 is planned but not yet implemented.
- **Live Search**: The live search functionality for quickly finding movies is currently in development and is not yet functional.
- **Custom Auto-scroll Slider**: A dynamic slider to display featured movies is planned and will be added soon.

I am actively working on these features and will update the project as they are completed.
